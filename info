Lab 1 Overview:
This lab is an intro to OOP in Java and version control using Git.
I implemented a Polynomial class to perform basic operations on polynomials, such as addition and evaluation.
Additionally, I learned how to set up a development environment, compile and run Java programs from the command line, and manage my code using Git and GitHub.
